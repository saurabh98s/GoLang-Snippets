# TESTING WITH GOLANG
<br>
Testing is hugely important in all software. Being able to ensure the correctness of your code and ensure that any changes you make donâ€™t end up breaking anything else in different parts of your codebase is hugely important.

By taking the time to adequately test your go programs you allow yourself to develop faster with a greater sense of confidence that what you are developing will continue to work when you release it to production.
